## Career Interview

Diffusion models have demonstrated strong results on image synthesis in past years. Now the research community has started working on a harder task—using it for video generation. The task itself is a superset of image generation, with additional complexity of temporal consistency.

### Key Challenges in Video Generation

- **Temporal Consistency**: Ensuring frames maintain logical continuity
- **Computational Complexity**: Processing sequential frames requires more resources
- **Quality-Speed Tradeoff**: High-quality generation often comes at the cost of speed
